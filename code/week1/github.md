# Github Setup Instructions

On the AWS instance, open the terminal and run the following code:

```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kontr0x/github-desktop-install/main/installGitHubDesktop.sh)"
```

Open GitHub Desktop and click sign in.

If you don't have a GitHub Account, please create one using your BYU-I numbered email.

Once you've signed in, leave the default settings for the email and click continue.

We want to create a repository on the desktop for all our files that we want to have access to outside the instance.

Click on the `Create Repository on your Hard Drive` option and designate the location as the Desktop. The name of this folder should be `itm111` all lowercase. For all files you will receive during this course, make a copy and place it in this folder.
